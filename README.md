# MSD-System-Model
Modeling of a simple, idealized mass, spring, and damper system 
Using a State-Space, a mathematical model of this physical system as a set of input, output, and state variables related by first-order differential equations. 

Matrices C and D are 3x2 and 3x1, respectively. This was intentionally made to obtain outputs of the mass's Position, Velocity, and Acceleration. 
To illustrate the dynamic system, I made use of MATLAB's ss(state-space model) function.
